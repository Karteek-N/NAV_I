# THE_STM32_PROJECT
Welcome to the repository for my custom STM32 board, a versatile hardware platform designed for seamless integration of GPS, pressure sensing, and IMU functionalities. This project aims to provide a robust solution for applications requiring precise location tracking, atmospheric pressure measurement, and motion sensing.

Key Features:

Microcontroller: STM32F722RET6
A high-performance microcontroller offering ample processing power and a rich set of peripherals.

GPS Modules:
Integrated GPS functionality for accurate positioning and location-based applications.

Pressure Sensor:
Inclusion of a precision pressure sensor for atmospheric pressure measurement.
Ideal for applications such as altimeter and weather monitoring.

IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):
Incorporation of an advanced IMU for motion sensing and orientation tracking.
Gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer for comprehensive motion data.
